// Endpoints collects all of the endpoints that compose an add service. It's
// meant to be used as a helper struct, to collect all of the endpoints into a
// single parameter.
//
// In a server, it's useful for functions that need to operate on a per-endpoint
// basis. For example, you might pass an Endpoints to a function that produces
// an http.Handler, with each method (endpoint) wired up to a specific path. (It
// is probably a mistake in design to invoke the Service methods on the
// Endpoints struct in a server.)
//
// In a client, it's useful to collect individually constructed endpoints into a
// single type that implements the Service interface. For example, you might
// construct individual endpoints using transport/http.NewClient, combine them into an Endpoints, and return it to the caller as a Service.
